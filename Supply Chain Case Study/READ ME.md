## üîç Case Study Overview
  - Richard‚Äôs Supply is a fictional supply chain company dealing with various food products. They collaborate with numerous suppliers and manage orders from multiple customers. This repository covers typical data management tasks and analysis scenarios that a supply chain database might encounter, from basic queries to complex analytical insights.

The database has been maintained for two years and includes tables for suppliers, customers, products, and orders. Each order may contain multiple products, quantities, and prices, providing a rich set of data for SQL practice.

## üìä Database Structure
The case study is based on a simplified Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram for a supply chain database that includes the following entities:

  - Suppliers: Each supplier offers specific products.
  - Customers: Customers place orders for products.
  - Orders: Each order may contain multiple items, quantities, and pricing details.
  - Products: Details of various food products sold by Richard‚Äôs Supply.
## ‚úçÔ∏è Questions and Exercises
  The SQL exercises are divided into four sections based on difficulty level:

### Section A: Level 1 Questions
- Basic data retrieval and simple analytical queries. Examples:
  - Read data from all tables.
  - Find the country-wise count of customers.
  -  Display non-discontinued products.
  
### Section B: Level 2 Questions
- Intermediate SQL concepts, such as aggregations and subqueries. Examples:
  - Calculate year-wise total revenue.
  - Find the top 3 suppliers by revenue generated.

### Section C: Level 3 Questions
- Advanced queries requiring a deeper understanding of SQL, such as complex joins and grouping. Examples:
  - Fetch customer details who ordered more than 10 products in a single order.
  - List companies that supply products costing over 100.
### Section D: Level 4 Questions
- Challenging queries that mimic real-world analytical questions. Examples:
  - Identify orders with the highest amount saved after applying discounts.
  - Display products for which the UK depends on other countries for supply.
  - Additional exercises are provided in each section for users to practice independently.
