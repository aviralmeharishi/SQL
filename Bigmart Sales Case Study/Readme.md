# 🏪 Big Mart SQL Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **SQL case study** on the **Big Mart dataset**, where I performed data analysis using SQL to extract insights related to sales, items, and outlets.

## 🛠 Dataset Schema
The dataset consists of three tables:

- **`items`**: Contains details about each item, such as weight, type, and MRP.
- **`outlets`**: Stores information about different outlets, including establishment year, size, and location type.
- **`sales`**: Represents transactions, linking items to outlets with sales figures.

### 🔗 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Below is the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the dataset:

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed
- **Sales Analysis**: Identified high and low-performing products based on sales trends.
- **Outlet Insights**: Analyzed store performance based on location, type, and establishment year.
- **Item Insights**: Explored item characteristics impacting sales.
- **Profitability Trends**: Assessed the impact of item pricing (MRP) on sales revenue.

## 📂 SQL Queries
The following SQL queries were executed in the study:
1. Total sales per outlet.
2. Best-selling items.
3. Outlet-wise average sales.
4. Sales trend over time.
5. Identifying underperforming outlets.


## 🔥 Key Findings
- Certain outlets contribute significantly more to revenue.
- Some item categories have a **higher demand** across multiple stores.
- Outlet **location and size** affect overall sales performance.
- Newer outlets have **lower average sales** compared to older ones.
