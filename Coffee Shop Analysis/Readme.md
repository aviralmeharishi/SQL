# ‚òï Coffee Shop Insights: A SQL Deep Dive üöÄ

Brew-tiful data ahead! This project explores a coffee shop's operations through the power of SQL. We're diving deep into customer behavior, product popularity, sales trends, and more. Get ready to uncover a latte data-driven insights!

## üìä Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive SQL analysis of a fictional coffee shop. The goal is to demonstrate various SQL techniques, from basic data retrieval to advanced analytical queries, to understand business performance and customer patterns.

The project includes:
* **Database Schema:** SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements for setting up the coffee shop database.
* **SQL Queries:** A collection of SQL queries designed to answer specific business questions, categorized by difficulty:
    * **Beginner Brews:** Basic `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions.
    * **Rookie Roasts:** Simple `JOINs`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, basic subqueries, and date functions.
    * **Intermediate Blends:** Complex `JOINs`, subqueries, window functions, `CASE` statements, and pivoting.
    * **Master Grinds:** Advanced window functions, complex logic, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and optimization concepts.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The core of our analysis lies in a relational database designed to capture key aspects of the coffee shop's activities. The main tables include:

* `customers`: Information about the coffee shop's clientele.
* `products`: Details about the coffee, tea, and other items sold.
* `orders`: Records of each customer transaction.
* `order_details`: Specific items included in each order.


## üîç SQL Queries & Analysis (`Coffee Shop Analysis.sql`)

The `Coffee Shop Analysis.sql` file is where the magic happens! It's packed with queries that progress in complexity, allowing you to explore the data from various angles.

**Examples of insights you can uncover:**
* Who are the most loyal customers?
* Which products are bestsellers?
* What are the peak order times or days?
* How do sales vary by region or customer segment?
* What are the month-over-month sales growth trends?
* Which products are frequently bought together?

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Set up the Database:**
    * Use the `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS coffee;` statement.
    * Run the `CREATE TABLE` statements (provided in a separate file or at the beginning of your SQL script) to create the `customers`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_details` tables in your `coffee` database.
    * *(Optional: Provide instructions or a script for populating the tables with sample data if you have one).*

2.  **Run the Queries:**
    * Open the `Coffee Shop Analysis.sql` file in your favorite SQL client (e.g., DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio).
    * Connect to your `coffee` database.
    * Execute the queries individually or in batches to explore the data and see the results.

## ‚ú® Potential Future Work

* Visualizing the query results using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* Developing a predictive model for customer churn or sales forecasting.
* Creating an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs).
